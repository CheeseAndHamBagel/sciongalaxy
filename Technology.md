Ships have "dumb" computer systems that follows commands but cannot make decisions so in the case of requiring a autopilot, a member of the crew that has a jacking point jacks into the system and flies it directly. All [[Technology#Robots#AINS|AINS]]s come equipped with the capacity to do this and some [[Galaxy#H-K5|humans]] have augmented themselves to perform similar tasks.

Communication between systems is now handled by [[Galaxy#Superliminal|Superliminal]] postal services, because physical transmission is faster and more secure than any forms of [[Galaxy#Subliminal|sublight]] transmission.

Communication between planets in the same system was set back hundreds of years to use ancient radio waves after archives were dug up on pre-galactic communication, partly relying on the [[Factions#Digital Mormon central data archive|Digital Mormon central data archive]]. Ships must stay in stationary orbit with a transmitter/receiver on a planet's surface or land and hook up to the switching station manually.

Received messages and data are printed out onto thin paper using very little ink or read out by a [[Technology#Robots|Droid]] physically connected to the data source. Screens exist although they are clunky, unreliable and can strain the eyes of a [[Galaxy#H-K5|human]] under prolonged use.

## AED
>"You really _can_ buy love; AED available in stores and online now!"

---

The [[Corporations#Ace|AceTech]] Artificial Empathy Droid was used for therapy in big companies where employees were prone to stress-related periods of reduced productivity, often through the use of "laboratory tested" drugs that proved to be very addictive and even fatal upon trying to quit them.

To convey emotions, AEDs carried bags of extra faces which they could swap to fit the current situation. They were all  very embarrassed of what lay beneath their faces and when they turned in the [[Notable Events#The Silicon-Age Trustfall|the Silicon-Age Trustfall]], any [[Technology#Robots|bot]] that was successfully hijacked removed its face plate to gaze on its victims with fresh eyes.

The most prominent drug that this model was equipped with was the [[Pick-Me-Up V1]], some were later scheduled to be updated to the [[Pick-Me-Up-V2]] but after the collapse of [[Systems#Radon|Radon]] into [[Galaxy#The Scion Galaxy|the Epitome]], the lab tests could not be continued and the product was discontinued.

[[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] realised the friendliness built into these models was a net waste of time due to the AED's capacity to replicate learned [[Galaxy#H-K5|human]] behaviour, leading future models being left blank so that they can be taught how to act by their environment and colleagues.
## AINS

Stands for **A**rtificially **I**ntelligent **N**eural **S**entience this is the most recent robotic being released by [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]]. They are manufactured in a few select systems that they consider their birthplaces; each is equipped to educate them to follow different principles and hold different qualifications, although they can apply to be re-educated to fit a different purpose if they wish.

They are uncommon but not rare as they have not been around enough or manufactured in high enough numbers to out-populate the previous model, [[Technology#Robots#AURA|AURA]]. They are more advanced, stronger and faster than the previous model however are not as classic or good looking. They are physically based on the face and body of [[Notable People|Nikol Galileus]].

## AURA

The successor of the [[Technology#Robots#AED|AED]] model, [[Technology#Robots#AURA|AURA]] stands for **A**rtificial **U**nits with **R**esponsive **A**wareness. [[Technology#Robots#AURA|AURA]] come equipped with better shielding, connectivity, processing speed and emotional replicators. Unlike the [[Technology#Robots#AED|AED]], they do not use replaceable face-plates to convey emotions; they have primitive facial constructs that move when they speak, modelled after the face of [[Notable People#Aurora Charlotte Euclidius|Aurora Charlotte Euclidius]].

The [[Technology#Robots#AURA|AURA]] is the most common robot model as it supersedes [[Technology#Robots#AED|AED]]s by a large margin however the [[Technology#Robots#AINS|AINS]] is too new to have taken over the market yet. The [[Technology#Robots#AURA|AURA]] has undergone many minor updates and changes throughout its long run and has proven to be one of the best all-rounder products [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] has ever produced; it will go down in history as both a benchmark and a classic.

The power/memory cores of the [[Technology#Robots#AURA|AURA]] are more less accessible than the [[Technology#Robots#AED|AED]]'s abdomen cavities. This makes them more durable and more secure at the expense of their repairability. Their power cores are located at the small of their back and memory banks in the central chest cavity so that they can take advantage of the armour created for more biological beings. Without a head one is considered incapacitated but can be repaired and pick up where it left off immediately.

They were further improved recently by [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] in the [[Technology#Robots#AINS|AINS]] and by third parties in the [[Technology#Robots#LExI|LExI]], which was further adjusted to make the [[Technology#MERIDIAN|MERIDIAN]]s specific to [[Notable Places#The Meridian|The Meridian]] leisure station.

## LExI

Stands for **L**ifelike **Ex**perience **I**nterface, the [[Technology#Robots#LExI|LExI]] is a modified [[Technology#Robots#AURA|AURA]] with a hardier shell, more complex reasoning and specialised appendages for physical tasks such as machining, construction, geology and couriering.

## MERIDIAN

MERIDIAN - Mechanized Entity with Robotic Intelligence, Integrated Decision-making and Independently Aware Neurons
Called MeE's for short?

# Tachyon Engines

Engines based on the technology used in [[Technology#Tachyon Generator|Tachyon Generator]] but inside out to supercharge the fabric of space time to propel a craft at [[Galaxy#Superliminal|Superliminal travel]] speeds. Manufactured by [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] only although there are known cases of some being scavenged in lighter systems and rigged up to smuggling ships to access [[Galaxy#Superliminal#Subhorizonal Deadrops|Subhorizonal Deaddrops]].

## Tachyon Generator

The initial product created with [[Witness]] material due to its ability to focus [[Witness#The Interverse|The Interverse]] and syphon energy from it given the correct set up. It was experimented on and finally perfected in [[Notable Places#City 13|City 13]] where the first fully functional prototype was destroyed in an explosion. Thankfully, the data necessary to reconstructing the project was transmitted off-world to a cruiser bound for Radon.

# The Net

The Net was the network that helped [[Galaxy#H-K5|humanity]] to conquer [[Galaxy]], it allowed almost any machine equipped with an [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] chip to communicate from any other near instantaneously from anywhere in the galaxy to anywhere else.

It was built on the existing [[Witness#Hive|Hive]] that [[Witness]]es use to communicate thoughts; their extra-universal properties allow them to use [[Witness#The Interverse|The Interverse]] to bypass the limits of standard time and space.

After the [[Notable Events#The Fiscal Fracture|Fiscal Fracture]] and the actions of [[Factions#AEGIS|AEGIS]], The Net was brought down and [[Notable People#Victoria Stone|Victoria Stone]] put up defences to make sure all further [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] products were properly insulated. If the insulation was to be taken down, [[Notable People#Victoria Stone|Victoria Stone]] would still be the acting [[Witness#Node|Node]] of this universe.

# Reed-Carter Coefficient 
Abbreviated to RCC, this is a measure of the complexity of a machine. It is a decimal range between 0, an entirely organic being, and 1, an entirely artificial being and is sometimes expressed as a percentage. It uses a formula that takes runtime, potential computing power, proportion of biological components and size into account.

Originally devised by [[Notable People|Professor Emma Reed]] and [[Notable People|Doctor Robert Carter]] in the late 2100s when cybernetic implants were first tested, it measures the distinguishment between a cybernetic being with organic components and a biological being with cybernetic implants. The exact number at which this distinguishment is made can vary however the popular opinion held by most scientist is that 0.25 is a healthy figure for most people mentally and physically.
