# AEGIS

Stands for The **A**lliance of **E**mpowered **G**overnments of **I**ndependent **S**ystems

This group started in the early 2550s but it took until the 70s for them to rise to power. The core of their belief is based around freedom and they believe that rampant capitalism has crushed the [[Galaxy#H-K5|Human]] soul. Their approach was drastic but, in their eyes, necessary. Protests started quite minor; hacking personal terminals of corporation higher-ups to cause chaos, constantly calling in fake bomb threats to halt workflow or hijacking ships that passed through allied systems. 

These proved ineffective so the hacking was escalated to deleting data, changing shipping details and even marking some employees for termination while that power was held by those below [[Corporations#Ace#The Board|The Board]]. The bomb threats were increased to real explosives. Often postal ships were hijacked and the real parcels' contents were swapped with timed explosives to go off when they were delivered. It was later uncovered a few postal drivers has been bought off and voluntarily compromised their packages.

The ship hijacking also escalated into stealing important ships, gutting the for valuables, setting their engines to blow and releasing them back to travel to their destination. These caused massive damage in the beginning and were the main motivation for the corporations to band together and go to war.

After crashing [[Technology#The Net|The Net]] and surrendering at the end of the war, [[Factions#AEGIS|AEGIS]] melted into obscurity, their names even being mostly stricken from the history data logs. They are rumoured to have been but a puppet of a much greater challenger that is soon to raise its head against [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]].
# BAAAS

Stands for **B**iological **A**lliance **A**gainst **A**rtificial **S**entience

Is  a faction that stands against [[Technology#Robots|Robots]] of any kind being considered or treated as citizens.

They arose after a group of religious extremist discovered that there wasn't a single mention of [[Technology#Robots|Robots]] in the [[Factions#Digital Mormon central data archive|Digital Mormonist archives]] and are a splinter group of [[Factions#Church of Digital Mormonism|Digital-Mormonism]].
# Church of Digital Mormonism

A group of so called religious zealots who believe that life was perfect before [[Galaxy#H-K5|humanity]] left the surface of [[Systems#Core|Core-3]], they insist on still calling it Earth.

They refuse to use products not made on their home planets and have reverted back to ancient technology, traversing with 2 - 4 wheeled land vehicles and building their houses from bricks. Their worlds tend to be crowded and polluted as they mine for solid fuel and populate every part of their surfaces without concern for how they effect the ecosystems.

They rarely leave a planet once the first settlers set up camp, often being reduced to double digit populations before being forced to move to the next.

The founder's name has been lost to time however followers of this faith consider themselves "Neo-Christians"; based on a religion called "Christianity" that is mentioned in the [[Factions#Digital Mormon central data archive|Digital Mormon central archive]] as the focal religion of the time. It ceased practice 400 years ago after a group of mathematicians categorically disproved its major premise of an entity existing inside the universe and have created it.

The technology used for the replacement of [[Technology#The Net|The Net]] was found in here and was already in use by Digital Mormons so those that choose to leave the faith behind are often employed as engineers, mechanics or operators due to their extensive training and knowledge on the subject of radio waves. In the last few decades they have been able to pass on such knowledge although the most prestigious places of education for network architecture and hardware are ran using the original principles of [[Factions#Church of Digital Mormonism|Digital-Mormonism]].

## Digital Mormon central data archive 

The central text of the [[Factions#Church of Digital Mormonism|Church of Digital Mormonism]], detailing what [[Systems#Core|Core-3]] was like before the [[Notable Places#City 13|City 13]] incident and [[Galaxy#H-K5|Humanity]] left to conquer the galaxy.

# The Law
#unfinished
--- SECTION UNFINISHED ---

decentralised law enforcement officers that can do whatever they want?
behavioural chip that instils every single law into them?
they are incorruptible and 100% reliable given the reliability of the evidence so are trusted wholeheartedly by the governing bodies that are given them?
can be people but when off-duty the chip is deactivated and they have no memory of any case work?
each officer has a platoon of cheap droid at its disposal to enforce the law. They are stupid but very hardy
they only follow the command of their officer and their officer's superiors?
