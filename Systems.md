It is less than an 8 hour [[Galaxy#Subliminal|Subliminal]] jump from [[Systems#Luminus|Luminus]].

This system is a set of 10 planets and 2 planetoid objects orbiting a binary star system. This causes the orbits of the planets to be warped and even change when the stars cross paths. Pyrion-\[8,9,9a,9b,10] are far enough from the stars to be unaffected by their odd gravitational configuration and so make excellent pit-stop areas for passing cruisers. The two stars make the skies on its planets look as if they've been split into two halves, each a different colour. The star system gives one of the most fantastic and yet remarkably niche spectacles in the galaxy.

 When the stars begin to cross over each other in the sky, and the sky's colours swap over, many of the inhabitants of the system organise parties and celebrate the swap. It is said the first sunrise of the new colour brings joy and luck to those that wake to view it.
