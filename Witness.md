# The Ascendancy

A hive mind being that lives between universes. It created the [[Galaxy#H-K5|human]] race because it is lonely and wanted some company beyond its own thoughts. The ultimate irony of its plight is that to survive [[Notable Events#The Unravelling|The Unravelling]], a being from inside the universe must be assimilated into the [[Witness#Hive|Hive]] and therefore surrender their individuality.
# Witness Material

Witness material is a curious substance; it is neither cells nor matter and can behave as both and neither simultaneously. It comes directly from the [[Witness#The Ascendancy]|Ascendancy]] which resides outside the universe and is not subject to the conditions of time nor force.

It has been shown to possess "life" in some circumstances and has been given the designation Lambda.
# Documented Forms

## Scouts

## Thieves

## Cleaners

## Directors
# Node
The central, or dominant, local personality. Usually unnecessary due to connection to the [[Witness#The Ascendancy]|Ascendancy]] however comes to power over witnesses should that connection be severed.
# Hive
The local mind that all [[Witness#Documented Forms|Witnesses]] share if uninhibited or unprotected.

# The Interverse

The space between universes, it is beyond the constraints of time and matter and often visualised as an infinite pool of energy. To survive there a living being must find a way to either remove their dimensional constrictions or hold them in place so they do not leak into the Interverse and cease to be.

Rumours of a single prototype ship from the Interverse will being to spread in a few millennia, a relic from an ancient future era of [[Galaxy#H-K5|Humanity]] that learns to live in peace with the forces beyond their universe.
