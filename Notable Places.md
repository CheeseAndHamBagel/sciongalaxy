It was built by in the corporate resurgence following the [[Notable Events#The Fiscal Fracture|Fiscal Fracture]], construction started around 2584 but it was not finished until 2599. It was opened the next ear in 2600 and was an immediate success, raking in profits and raving reviews by the day. Since then it has lulled in popularity although it has thousands of whales that stay on the regular to spend their credits.

Lots of vents and hidden employee hallways to make sure everywhere can accessed by staff easily. Only the most important rooms have cameras (due to the [[Notable Events#The Silicon-Age Trustfall]| Silicon-Age Trustfall]]) but all rooms have armed guard patrols, even those with cameras.
