# The Fiscal Fracture

During the 2570s a war broke between Corporations and [[Factions#AEGIS|AEGIS]], a faction that wanted to stop them taking over all of society by killing those at the heads of the snakes; primarily [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]], [[Corporations#MotionBank|MotionBank]], [[Corporations#OmniCorp|OmniCorp]], and [[Corporations#TitaniCorp|TitaniCorp]] who together controlled more than 95% of all money going through the galactic economy. Many companies fell in the war, [[Corporations#OmniCorp|OmniCorp]] being the most prolific one, including many minor financial institutions and legal organisations which had tried to play on both sides of the war and were turned on by both by the end.

As wars waged on planets across the outer tracks and espionage became rife in the inner ones, a lone figure came to dominate in both fields. [[Notable People#Victoria Stone#V-01|V-01]] rose to prominence with in-depth knowledge of how [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] functioned, a hitherto unknown capacity for disguises and a prototype weapon that somehow allowed it to temporarily travel faster than light.

In the coming decades following the war, stories of [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]]'s secret killer spread across the galaxy to scare high profile criminals and any one else who wanted to publicly flaunt their less-than-legal triumphs.

In the end of the war, [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] revealed their advances in [[Galaxy#Superliminal|Superliminal travel]]. The first projects to be unveiled were early Ballista-Class cruisers which could carry entire battalions of the prototype Cleaver-Class Skirmishers. The ability to cross the entire galaxy near instantly quickly showed [[Factions#AEGIS|AEGIS]] that they were outgunned by many magnitudes.

In a last ditch effort before their surrender, [[Factions#AEGIS|AEGIS]] decided to turn [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]]'s own products against them and poisoned [[Technology#The Net|The Net]], causing any openly communicating witness machines to seize up and turn on their makers. This event became known as [[Notable Events#The Silicon-Age Trustfall|the Silicon-Age Trustfall]] as humans came to see the damage that interconnectivity could do.

Following this realisation, [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] recalled their bots and [[Notable People#Victoria Stone|Victoria Stone]] installed the network blockers across the product line, stationing herself as the [[Witness#Node|Node]] in this universe while simultaneously blocking cross-universal communication.

# Operation Nightfall

# The Silicon-Age Trustfall
After [[Factions#AEGIS|AEGIS]] crashed [[Technology#The Net|The Net]] during the [[Notable Events#The Fiscal Fracture|Fiscal Fracture]] and [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] products turned on their owners, [[Galaxy#H-K5|humanity]] lost trust in machines and realised how dangerous a hive minded computer system could be.

Thus they lost trust in computers resulting in any [[Technology#Robots|Artificial Intelligence]] to be stricken down and destroyed.

# The Unravelling

[[Technology#TachyonEngines|Tachyon Engines]] cause tears in the fabric of the universe when it is compressed and stretched to propel a craft [[Galaxy#Superliminal|Superliminal]] speeds. Eventually this will cause the boundaries of dimensional space to collapse
