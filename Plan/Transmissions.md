This message comes directly after the initial orders and seems to be written in a friendly tone, as if it is from a friend.

*The crew of the Flagrant Disregard,*

*I regret the formalities but the official orders are the only reliable way to spread a message these days. Some of these brutes will only take a job if it seems like it is from a corpo. I can assure you I am not one of them.*

*My name is Caite and the job I have for you is to find a thief who stole some precious memories from me. They have been on the run for a long time now and I am getting desperate. The authorities have not been able to apprehend them so I must turn to you due to your reputation for discretion and results.*

*I have done my own digging and discovered that they will reside on a gambling station known as The Meridian. This station is a known hub of scum and villainy so feel no regard for any collateral damage you deal, none there are without sin deserving of such a deed.*

*I have put up all the money I have for this operation, equating to about quadruple your regular fee, and I will send a quarter in advance to pay for equipment, travel, tickets, whatever you need to complete this.*

*These memories are worth more to me than money so the fee is negotiable should complications arise.*

*Yours thankfully,*

*Caite Trivonos*

# Charon Response

#Phase1 
After the [[Transmissions#Orders|Orders]] come through, [[Corporations#Charon|Charon]] will contact any double agents with this message:

`MESSAGE_INBOUND(SECURE_SIG=8, ENCRYPTION_TYPE='Halcyon4.0', RECIPIENT_TRUSTED=True) READS:`

We have intercepted the recent memo detailing the planned asset liquidation on The Meridian, an Inter-planetary Orbital Station current enroute to Lumis 6 in the Luminus System. Our intel indicates that the liquidation will have significant consequences that could adversely impact our  interests. We believe that the assets in question concern a deal we made with a critical party regarding important information. The disposal of either poses a threat to our shared objectives.

Our intelligence suggests that time is of the essence, and we implore you to take immediate action to halt the liquidation process. Any support you can provide, whether through legal channels, strategic intervention, or other means, would be crucial in safeguarding our interests.

We trust that you share our commitment and hope for a swift and successful collaboration to prevent the undesired consequences outlined in the intercepted memo.

The plan is in motion,

-**C**
