#Phase1 
This is the introductory phase. The players are an up-and-coming crew of mercenaries barely scraping by. They receive an [[Transmissions#Fixer note]] from [[Player Data#Oroy-on Frost]], 3 days before its official release. Any double agents will receive the [[Transmissions#Charon Response]] from their secret contact.

#Phase2 
The players can scout [[Notable Places#The Meridian]] to formulate their plan.
They also have this phase to gather any intel or equipment they need for the mission or to locate the target.
Push them towards pretending to be passengers? Or brute force?

There are a few NPCs they can try and talk to to get equipment or a plan, their criminal contacts will come in useful here.

#Phase3
The player's plan is put into motion and they enter the Meridian

#Phase4 
Alarm is raised

#Phase5
DAY 3: [[COMPETING MERC GROUP 1]] arrives on the scene, they choose a stealth approach. One poses as a high-paying guest, one as an engineer and two smuggle themselves inside by hiding in the supply containers loaded in from the surface of [[Systems#Luminus]]

DAY 5:  [[Notable People#Victoria Stone]] makes sure that the the data is contained, she was already onboard under a pseudonym, [[PSEUDONYM]]. She sabotages the engines to cause it to crash and begins executing anyone she comes across to try and flush the data breacher out
