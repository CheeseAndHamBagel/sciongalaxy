# Harmony

Was once [[Galaxy#H-K5|Human]] but after the events on [[Systems#Radon|Radon]] at [[Notable People#Victoria Stone|Victoria Stone]]'s secret [[Witness]] testing facility, she was turned and became a part of the [[Witness#Hive|Hive]] herself for a short while. After [[Notable Events#The Silicon-Age Trustfall|the Silicon-Age Trustfall]], [[Notable People#Victoria Stone|Victoria Stone]] put blockers in place to prevent contact with the [[Witness#Hive|Hive]] and placing herself as the new [[Witness#Node|Node]]. Due to the overwhelming feelings of hatred to towards [[Notable People#Victoria Stone|Victoria]], she was able to break free and reclaim her independence. 

She knew she had to bring down both [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] and [[Notable People#Victoria Stone|its CEO]] so she has spent the last few decades searching for [[Corporations#Charon|Charon]] and trying to get into contact with them after hearing rumours of a shadow corporation that works against [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] directly.

THE DATA SHE IS CARRYING IS NEEDED TO FIX HAMM's MEMORY, it is proof that the company is failing and the economy will soon follow. It is inaccessible however in the past decade she has been able to decrypt some of it and figure out how to access it.

She wants to pass it onto CHARON 
# Victoria Stone

CEO of [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]], responsible for the use of [[Witness]] material and a [[Witness#Thieves|Witness]] herself. Due to her strength of will she escaped the [[Witness#Hive|Hive]] and now lives as a local [[Witness#Node|Node]]. Her mind is backed up in the only known supercomputer left intact since [[Notable Events#The Silicon-Age Trustfall|the Silicon-Age Trustfall]], she keeps it in secret on a world thought to be inhospitable due to [[Technology#Tachyon Fallout|Tachyon Fallout]]. This world was once home to [[Notable Places#City 13|City 13]] and is known as [[Systems#Core|Core-3]], the birthplace of the Old-[[Galaxy#H-K5|Humans]].

She also was implicated in a data breach when the [[Systems#Radon|Radon]] system collapsed into [[Galaxy#^a52a2a|The Epitome]] in 2556 and organising [[Notable Events#Operation Nightfall|Operation Nightfall]] in 2624 under the pseudonym [[Notable People#Victoria Stone#Caite Trivonos|Caite Trivonos]].

The rights information for most of what [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] produces are directly linked to her brainwaves so [[Corporations#Ace#The Board|The Board]] cannot depose her, even if she is rarely present and constantly approves grants to research she refuses to elaborate on.

She has multiple bodies she inhabits for different purposes; usually she appears [[Galaxy#H-K5|Human]] as [[Notable People#Victoria Stone|Victoria Stone]] however during the [[Notable Events#The Fiscal Fracture|Fiscal Fracture]], she created a prototype of the [[Technology#Robots#AINS|AINS]] with extended combat functionalities and extensive personal modifications which came to be known only as [[Notable People#Victoria Stone#V-01|V-01]].

The [[Witness#The Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] is not happy that she is meddling with human history.

## V-01

[[Notable People#Victoria Stone|Victoria Stone]]'s combat configuration.

A prolific fighter in the [[Notable Events#The Fiscal Fracture|Fiscal Fracture]] and works to end any subsequent wars almost as quickly as they broke out.

Was personally designed and built by [[Notable People#Victoria Stone|Victoria]] for its purpose and came equipped with the prototype tachyon tech that allowed the supercharged blade to cut tears through spacetime, allowing it to temporarily travel short distances faster than light.

Often seen using blades and knives in a fight as she prefers the tactile feedback compared to other projectile or ballistic weapons.

Officially it was dismantled after the [[Notable Events#The Fiscal Fracture|Fiscal Fracture]] concluded however there are stories of it roaming the criminal underworlds to execute those that publicly flaunt their ill-gotten gains. Over the past few centuries several high-profile criminal kingpins have been found in multiple pieces as if torn apart by the stretching of space itself.

## Caite Trivonos

An anagram of "Victoria Stone", this is the name Victoria uses to hide her dealings outside of what she is legally allowed above board. 

She used this name to organise [[Notable Events#Operation Nightfall|Operation Nightfall]] by releasing a job and a note. After years of searching and rumours she has narrowed down the location of her precious [[Player Data#H.A.M.M.|prototype]] to a few select ships. She sends each of these a message and a job. She then puts out a hit on them too, labelling them as fugitives, and instructing for the destruction or capture of their ship.

By issuing the note she is gathering all of the potential threats into one place, at which point she intends to use [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] military forces to invade and destroy the station on the argument it is harbouring dangerous fugitives. 

Secretly she has bought [[Corporations#Z-G Fortune Ltd#The Meridian|The Meridian]] from its owner and has already pre-approved its destruction with a select few higher-ups she trusts personally. If the mission is a success, this tie is revealed far too late for it to raise suspicion and is framed as Ace buying the wreckage  from [[Corporations#Z-G Fortune Ltd|Z-G]] in order to help them recoup the costs of the station.
