>"Business is *good*, but it can always be *better*"

Ace, formerly AceTech, is a massive company once specialising in weapons, domestic produce, security, robotics and intelligence research. Now Ace has rebranded to cover mostly [[Galaxy#Superliminal|Superliminal Travel]]. The current CEO has been near AWOL for the past few years following her research and consolidating plans on how to combat [[Witness]]es in the coming wars.

Solely responsible for [[Notable Events#The Unravelling|The Unravelling]] in this era of humans however blame it mostly on [[Notable Events#Temporal Fractures|Temporal Fractures]] which cause turbulence when traveling [[Galaxy#Superliminal|superliminally]].

[[Corporations#Sphere Intelligence|Spint]] is now a subsidiary of Ace after it was bought out and reassigned to work entirely on the [[Technology#AINS|AINS]]. Other models that may be encountered include [[Technology#AED|AED]], [[Technology#LExI|LExI]] and [[Technology#AURA|AURA]] although some have been modified to withstand specific climates

Directly in control of the few [[Technology#Tachyon Generator|Tachyon Generator]]s that supply power across the galaxy. They are on a planetary scale and distributed evenly across Ace systems so that citizens have easy access to power.

## The Board
The shareholders in charge of [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]]. 

No one under The Board knows anyone above it.

[[Notable People#Victoria Stone|Victoria Stone]] is the only entity that exists above The Board.

They are all powerful and always achieve the outcome they want; they value power over money.

## Ace Racer
A subsidiary of [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] that focusses on consumer [[Galaxy#Superliminal|Superliminal travel]].

## SaberSteel
A small experimental weapons manufacturer acquired by Ace and dissolved after the end of [[Notable Events#The Fiscal Fracture|the war]] [[Notable Events#The Fiscal Fracture|]]
# Charon
A secret and elusive company that is known by so few that it has never been proven to exist beyond a rumour. It is responsible for giving the governments that formed [[Factions#AEGIS|AEGIS]] the final push that made them take a stand against [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] and caused the [[Notable Events#The Fiscal Fracture|The Fiscal Fracture]].

# Dragonis

Specialising in [[Galaxy#Subliminal|Subliminal travel]] and de-tuning [[Technology#Tachyon Engines|Tachyon Engines]] for less than galaxy-spanning journeys, Dragonis is seen as [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]]'s greatest competitor by some and its greatest ally by others. If it they had not cornered the market as they have done, Ace would have an entire market of [[Galaxy#Subliminal|Subliminal travel]] that uses solid fuel engines whereas Dragonis often purchases the rights to the previous generation [[Technology#Tachyon Engines|Tachyon Engines]] to make their [[Galaxy#Subliminal|Subliminal]] cruisers and fighters.

Often called on by the  military to make specialised craft, they are renown for their durability and efficiency. Their logo is ubiquitous on the battlefield, more often on both sides than not.

Armaments are usually developed in-house but they sometimes reach out to [[Corporations#IBaSS|IBaSS]] for hull reinforcement when they lack the expertise and to [[Corporations#Wrathwhile Systems|Wrathwhile Systems]] or [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] when more firepower is deemed to be required.

# IBaSS

Short for International Banking and Security Solutions. Heavily implicated in the calamity that befell [[Notable Places#City 13|City 13]] around 80-100 years ago. They specialised in surveillance and weaponry but since the [[Notable Events#The Silicon-Age Trustfall|Silicon-Age Trustfall]] they have had to shift away from remote surveillance and into hull plating/vehicle armour.

Rumoured to be a part of [[Factions#The Merger|the Merger]].

# Kosmo

Kosmo are a pharmaceutical and consumables company that make a wide range of products from antihistamines to hot dogs. Almost every vegetable grown in this era of [[Galaxy#H-K5|Humanity]] can be bought through them or is grown by one of their farmers. They generally cater to [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] worlds as they are the most well connected on [[Galaxy#Superliminal|Superliminal]] highways however anyone anywhere can open a branch of this franchise to sell goods properly prepared for the travel. In very light and disconnected worlds often the only products on sale are vacuum sealed, freeze dried or canned although some dried animal meat is available. Kosmo branches on systems with power can also stock frozen items although this depends on the accessible transport options. 

Few [[Technology#Robots|Robots]] have the capacity to consumer even semi-organic matter so Kosmo sells almost entirely to [[Galaxy#H-K5|Human]]s

# Omnicon
What remained of [[Corporations#OmniCorp|OmniCorp]] was disbanded and came together in secret to form Omnicon. They currently produce no official product and their existence is unknown to most. However, their logo has been spotted on various things on lighter worlds such as data disks and [[Galaxy#Superliminal Ships|Superliminal ships]].

# Wrathwhile Systems

> "If _that_ can't punch through, there is a bigger one that _will_."

Created by the late Mr Louis Wrathwhile in the late 26th century, Wrathwhile Systems is a weapons manufacturer known for specialising in physical rounds. The quality and effectiveness of such weapons as made made their business a very lucrative one, in both legal and extra-legal markets; earning them a reputation for being the best in the galaxy.

Their physical rounds are kwon galaxy-wide for their penetration power and damage potential, for almost any thickness of hull. They often supply weapons to [[Corporations#Dragonis|Dragonis]] for their warships and allegedly sell in bulk to black market dealers.

In addition to their large-scale warship supplies, Wrathwhile Systems also has a sister company called [[Corporations#Wrathwhile Systems#Wrathwhile Arms|Wrathwhile Arms]]. This offshoot specialises in smaller scale weapons, miniaturised to be used by humans. They are often favoured by mercenaries due to them sharing the same good qualities as their big brothers from Wrathwhile systems

## Wrathwhile Arms
Started after the death of Louis Wrathwhile and the end of the [[Notable Events#The Fiscal Fracture|Fiscal Fracture]], Louis Wrathwhile II realised that the fear caused by the fallout of the war was a rife market for a personal small arms dealer specialising in pacification and self defence. These weapons are often seen in the hands of mercenary groups and black market dealers due to their simplicity, repairability and sheer power.

[[Galaxy#H-K5|Human]] users often get augmentations to their upper appendages when wielding the high calibre/power weapons because some particularly high end models have recoil too powerful enough for biological tissue to withstand. Wrathwhile Arms makes these weapons anyway as they are very popular.

### UNDER REVIEW

	The flagship product of Wrathwhile Arms is the WR-45 "Wrathful" pistol, a semi-automatic handgun chambered in .45 caliber. Known for its reliability and stopping power, the Wrathful is a favorite among private security firms and individuals seeking personal protection.
	
	Another popular offering from Wrathwhile Arms is the WR-72 "Vindicator" assault rifle. This weapon boasts a high rate of fire and exceptional accuracy, making it an excellent choice for combat situations. Its modular design allows for easy customization and adaptation to different mission requirements.
		
	Despite some controversy surrounding their association with mercenaries and black market dealers, Wrathwhile Arms maintains that their weapons are meant to empower individuals in dangerous situations. They argue that it is the responsibility of the user, not the manufacturer, to ensure ethical usage.
	
	With their reputation for quality craftsmanship and cutting-edge technology, Wrathwhile Arms continues to be a leading name in the personal arms market. Whether it's self-defense or professional security needs, their products are designed to deliver unrivaled performance when it matters most.

# Z-G Fortune Ltd
Zero-Gravity Fortune Limited own [[Notable Places#The Meridian|The Meridian]] and was formed only just before the construction contract as drawn up. They now own a multitude of casinos across the galaxy including [[Corporations#The Capstone|The Capstone]], [[Corporations#The Crescendome|The Crescendome]], [[Corporations#The Crest|The Crest]] and [[Corporations#The Crown|The Crown]], each of which are newer, bigger, more popular and (most importantly) more profitable than [[Notable Places#The Meridian|The Meridian]] and no doubt contributed to its decline in new players.

They specialise in coercing normal people to bet even if they don't have the money by having in-house lawyers to write up contracts for Tabs before they even spend any money. In the newer machines, the desperation of the player is what effects the likelihood of winning; players who just put a little in have a higher chance win enough to almost break even, desperate players have a very small chance of winning big and those in-between are strung along to get them from the former into into the latter category.
