# The Scion Galaxy

The Scion galaxy is [[Galaxy#H-K5|mankind]]'s home galaxy, although the location of their home planet [[Systems#Core|Core-3]] is unknown. It is a spiral around a central black hole, The Epitome. One orbit of The Epitome is an Era. Traveling towards the rim is 'lighter and towards the centre is 'heavier' or 'darker' due to the proximity to the black hole, increased population and the cosmic pollution fogging the orbits of more central star systems.

Every era signifies that a given system is 1 track closer to the black hole and its demise. Some important worlds are held in stable orbit near the centre and generally hold corporate or Governmental headquarters.

Very expensive, experimental measures can be used to move worlds between systems. This is usually used by the richest 0.001% humans to ever live to move their homes around to more favourable systems should it peak their fancy. 

Wild worlds, worlds without official civilisation, are common across the lighter tracks of the galaxy because humans tend to stay together where the work and housing is: towards populated, darker, worlds. 

There are some small black holes littered between galaxies. These are sometimes used as [[Galaxy#Subhorizonal Deadrops|Subhorizonal Deaddrops]] by those who have access to [[Galaxy#Superliminal|Superliminal travel]] and wish to hide a physical transaction from all parties involved.

## Planetary Categorising

Due to their overwhelming number, individual planets are rarely named. The protocol for naming is that the celestial object, be that a star, black hole, binary system or etc, at the centre of the system is given a name and planets are given associated numbers ascending from the centre. Any moons or sub-planetary orbiting objects are given the name of their closest planet followed by a letter. Often these change so the letters are distributed ascending from what was discovered first. For example the ill-fated Radon system had 8 planets; Radon-6 was an oceanic planet, and the 6th furthest from the sun. If Radon-6 were to have been discovered to have had a moon, it would have been assigned the identifier Radon-6a.

# Time

The premise of an hour and its subsidiary time delimitations have been maintained from [[Galaxy#H-K5|humankind's]] days on [[Systems#Core|Core-3]] despite their departure form the system. A Galactic Standard Day is 30 hours long, divided into 3 decimal Galactic Standard Segments. The internal [[Galaxy#H-K5|human]] body clock  has adjusted over the years of galactic travel due to the exposure to screens, differing gravity and cross-system 'jet-lag' among other factors.

When dealing in the same system it is acceptable to use the term 'rotation' to mean one entire rotation of a planet and a 'year' is a single orbit of a planet around its star.

In some systems is it customary to reserve one Galactic Standard Segment for rest each day although most corporate-controlled worlds view this rest as the time employees are off work rather than asleep.

Instead of the archaic 'month' and 'week' system, the days are arranged across Galactic Standard Sectors, which have 8 days each. A Galactic Standard Year is made of 36 GSSects.

Standard payday is the last day of every GSSect so the citizens of the galaxy are encouraged to stick to the calendar as if they miss the pickup on the eighth, the company is no longer required to pay them.

---
## In summary:
- 10 hours per GSSeg
- 3 GSSegs per GSDay
- 8 GSDays per GSSect
- 288 GSDays in a GSYear
- 36 GSSects in a GSYear

# Travel

## Superliminal

Travel above the speed of light, only available using [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] brand [[Technology#Tachyon Engines|Tachyon Engines]], almost exclusively used outside of atmospheres to travel between systems across [[Galaxy#The Scion Galaxy|the galaxy]]. Superliminal travel takes up about 96.7% of all interstellar travel in the galaxy but >1% of surface travel because at such short distances it is near redundant to breach the limit.

Superliminal travel can be consumer, freight, postal or corporate. All official methods of Superliminal travel are owned and operated by [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] or one of its specialised subsidiaries such as [[Corporations#Ace#Ace Racer|Ace Racer]]; a domestic, shortrange trend company marketed as the fastest, cheapest and most convenient to jump to a neighbouring system. Superliminal travel was discovered to be very safe, the only danger being matter overwriting when rematerializing at the destination although most ships here a collision avoidance system that offsets them in a random direction until there is a free space.

If a collision occurs, atoms in the area have been known to combine to form their sum with a combined total of elections. All is experimenting in secret on predicting the outcomes of such a phenomenon to be able to transition matter between elements, however the conditions required for this are very difficult to replicate. Smuggling is very uncommon but on lighter worlds there are small and deeply hidden networks based on stolen [[Technology#Tachyon Engines|Tachyon Engines]] from crashed [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] liners. These are difficult to arrange without prior knowledge as [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] quickly reprimands those that search for it.

### Subhorizonal Deadrops
The advent of [[Galaxy#Superliminal|Superliminal]] travel means that ships are able to surpass the exit velocity required even when below the event horizon of a black hole. Dead drop locations are placed at [[Galaxy#Superliminal|Superliminal]] orbit speeds just beneath such horizons, rendering them untraceable but only accessible at specific coordinates and times. Missing the entry window will result in [[Galaxy#Superliminal|Superliminal]] entry into a black hole. There are no confirmed reports of what happens when tachyon engines hit their limit in a black hole, although [[Corporations#Ace|Ace]] scientists report theories that link to breaching into the [[Witness#The Ascendancy|Ascendacy]]'s realm or speeding up [[Notable Events#The Unravelling|The Unravelling]].
## Subliminal

 Subliminal space travel, comprising only 4% of recorded travel encompasses two main categories: suspended animation ships and observatory safari ships.

Observatory safari ships provide an opportunity for artists to explore and draw inspiration from the cosmos. These specialized vessels are equipped with advanced observation equipment and technology, enabling passengers to witness celestial phenomena first-hand. Artists who seek to tap into the vastness of the universe as a source of creativity opt for this mode of travel.

The allure of subliminal travel lies in its ability to offer isolation and cryogenic storage. The seclusion provided by suspended animation or the vastness of space experienced on observatory safari ships creates an environment conducive to reducing burnout. The intense mental stimulation derived from such journeys is believed to unlock untapped potential within the brain, allowing for enhanced creativity.

For affluent artists seeking new avenues to explore their artistic abilities or simply looking for respite from the demands of their craft, subliminal travel presents an enticing solution. However, due to its exclusive nature and high costs associated with both construction and maintenance of these specialized ships, this form of travel remains accessible only to a privileged few.

Since the universe is functionally infinite, and [[Galaxy#Superliminal|Superliminal travel]] allows near instant closure of once-impassable distances, solid fuel for standard engines is cheap and plentiful so is still used often for planetary travel.

While fuel is rarer, [[Technology#TachyonEngines|Tachyon Engines]] are easier to build, more efficient and significantly more durable than standard intra universal propulsion methods. Some choose to underdrive old [[Technology#TachyonEngines|Tachyon Engines]] to force them to stay at subliminal speeds, using significantly less fuel. competitive sports have bans on super liminal speeds so while some competition crafts have [[Technology#TachyonEngines|Tachyon Engines]], they are heavily policed and specifically restricted. Land travel is generally slow, comprising mostly of animals, Super liminal tubes, public shuttle buses, personal shuttles, subliminal tributary tubes and personal aeroskimmers. The animals use vary in quantity, size, speed and number of legs although the must common are flying hexapedal lizards due to theirs shook. locomotion s ease of domestication and environmental versatility. The Rich offer purchase wingfish and pedal birds for racing, pulling skimmers or just showing off. [[Galaxy#Superliminal|Superliminal travel]] tubes are used only on corporate worlds as they are expensive and, at a planetary scale, redundant. subliminal tubes are magnitudes more common and are often the easiest way to travel long distances on a planets surface. Shuttles are small, I to 8 person ships. some have small [[Technology#TachyonEngines|Tachyon Engines]] that allow for [[Galaxy#Superliminal|Superliminal]] jumps should an emergency arise. Due to the cost of manufacturing and fuelling, these are more common on darker worlds.

# H-K5

Also known as "Humans" to most, or "New-Humans" to archaeologists. Mostly bipedal creatures descendant from ancient Hominidae. They possess neither tails, wings nor fur although they have thin hair that can grow to cover parts of their body. On average most humans tend to look quite similar; they vary little in height, weight or limb configuration except for extreme cases. Most are non-hostile, even talkative, in their default state and will welcome questions about their genetic configuration and identification.

Recently they have begun to trust computers less and less, likely due to [[Notable Events#The Silicon-Age Trustfall|the Silicon-Age Trustfall]]. This has led them to augment themselves so as not rely on computer programming to do technological tasks, although these tasks are still limited. Most commonly, augmentations include stronger bones/joints, replacement of missing limbs, technological interfacing ports and visual changes to set them apart from their fellow Humans.

Drastic differences in conditions between planets and systems has caused some offshoots of the original line to be made. Often these are designated H-K5\[a to j] to signify which variant they are. For example [[Galaxy#H-K5a|H-K5a]] was the first recorded variant. There only exist 10 recorded variants currently.

Humans are inquisitive and inventive creatures; using their expertise and intelligence they have spread across the galaxy continue to wrestle against the forces of the universe itself. They know not the consequences their actions will have. 

H-K5 originated on Earth but since the [[Notable Places#City 13|City 13]] incident, that planet has been lost to time. [[Notable People#Victoria Stone|Victoria Stone]] had the entire system wiped off the records to hide her experiments and secret projects. It is said that Earth is populated entirely by extensions of her because she realised there was no one else she could trust.

## Variants
All variants are colloquially referred to as "Alternate Humans", or just "Alts" for short. 
### H-K5a

Often referred to as "Lunars", H-K5a are best suited for the colder and dryer climates of moons or planets that are smaller or colder than the standard habitation requirements for a human. The atmosphere on such worlds tends to have less radiation shielding than [[Systems#Core|Core-3]] had so H-K5a have thicker, darker, blueish skin on average that can better protect them against the radiation and weather. Their thicker skin makes growing hair quite a challenge, so some use growth stimulators on their scalp to encourage a style - to fit into the rest of society. They are the first recorded variant of [[Galaxy#H-K5|H-K5]], mostly similar to their genetic cousins although They also tend to be stronger and faster due to employment on such worlds tending to be more physical than corporate. Often seen in military and extra-military professions due to their cultivated advantages.
### H-K5b

Known as "Aquas", H-K5b are a variant of [[Galaxy#H-K5|H-K5]] that have adapted to live in amphibious or even aquatic environments. They have slightly webbed fingers and toes, streamlined bodies for swimming, eyes better suited for low-light environments and tend to grow very little body hair anywhere other than their scalp. Their spines protrude considerably more through their back than humans to aid stability in submarine currents. Their skin is usually lighter in colour to blend in with the ocean environment and often exhibits a grey or greenish tint. Aquas are highly skilled swimmers and excel in underwater exploration and research. Aquas are often found on water-based worlds or working in marine sciences.

### H-K5c

Often called "Teks", H-K5c were once human although not in the same way as the other variants. Teks are very rare because the process to create on is prohibitively expensive. They are humans, or similar, who have used cybernetic implants and modifications to reach above 0.88 [[Technology#Reed-Carter Coefficient|RCC]] resulting in them no longer being comparable to regular humans or even other organic variants.

Due to the high quantity and even higher cost of the numerous procedures required to create a Tek, they are limited to the highest sect of galactic high earners. Often seen in ownership positions of systems or corporations, their appearance can vary wildly. Their skin can be any range of colours and materials but it is never the same texture or colour as real skin, lest they be mistaken for a regular man.

They also often possess neural interfaces that allow them to directly activate non-robotic machines around them. Their eyes glow when they do this although the colour is their choice when ocular implants are installed.

The implants they get replace almost every part of their body, even their blood, allowing them to live functionally forever although there have been no long term studies about what such stress would do to the mind. Some theorise the hemo-cites will be able to repair any damage as fast as it appears, until the patient reaches a critical threshold of deterioration; when the machine cannot keep them alive and they begin to die. Others say that the stress of interfacing with so much and the isolation that Teks often choose can cause a higher chance of dementia. This could result in the damaged parts being overwritten and the user falling back to the basic functions of the implants, becoming no more than a protocol machine, an empty shell of who it used to be.
