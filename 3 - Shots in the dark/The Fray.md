The year is 110,003AD, the last vestiges of humanity are dying alone across the galaxy. interplanetary travel is not only expensive but also pointless. There would be nothing to gain out there and only misery to share. Humans number in the tens of millions, dotted across a handful of stars in each sector. This iteration know they are the last, every person can feel is in their bones that time is running out. As the stars die around them and planets go cold they have huddles around the heat that remain, each remaining star becoming a symbol of life and hope in its own right.

We find ourselves orbiting a start called [[GOD OF THE FORGE]], on its closest planet. 

Houses are well insulted and topped with radar-dish mirrors to direct as much sunlight inside as possible.
