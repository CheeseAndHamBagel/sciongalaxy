## Chapter 1 - PROLOGUE

Sierra sighed as she poured her seventh cup of Nico-Tea of the day. It had been a long week and an even longer Friday; she thought she deserved a treat. As she leaned forward onto the countertop, the strands of her brown hair hanging in front of her face caught a glint of blue from the sun. The light washed the entire room in an azure glaze so she felt no need to turn on any Glo-Bulbs. She was wearing a thin and light long-sleeve top that was unfortunately not pricey enough to provide much warmth yet thankfully cheap enough to be windproof. It was company-issued and the material balance was off so it had shrunk to being almost skintight in the last wash cycle; Sierra could not wait to be rid of it when she was finally able to afford the Quitting Fee. Over that, she had green overalls with a harness around her upper leg attached to a central ring on the front and back. She wasn’t allowed to bring company property back home so she wasn’t wearing her usual tool belt. On the back of the overalls was the Kosmo logo, emblazoned in a day-glo bright lime. The legs were stained with mud and pesticides.

  

She had left her boots at the door so as not to track mud everywhere and was walking around the house in her pair of lucky red and blue striped socks. They had not brought her much luck today. Her pay was being cut for the fifth time in twelve months despite inflation rising every damn day. If she didn’t know any better she’d estimate that this was just part of the routine ebb and flow of a healthy economy. But she did know better. Today she’d finally put the pieces together. She had to escape. She knew she had to start running soon to outrun the collapse. Thankfully she had a few more months of normalcy, she hoped, to gather the supplies and courage to start moving. For now, she was content to just resume her regular life in her regular home.

  

The main room of her apartment was in an open-plan layout. Sierra had tried her best to divide the pieces of it up even if just by the arrangement of furniture and notable decorations. On the right of the doorway was the kitchen area which curved around the right wall and reached a small window on the far side. It was set into the corners and under the counter sat various appliances, drawers and cupboards. In the centre of the kitchen, there was an island, finished to look the same material as the countertop, which had a few power outlets and a water filter in the centre. This is normally where she sat to eat breakfast, leaning on the barstool that sat next to it; she seldom had time in the mornings to set out cutlery or cook anything complicated. Her dishes from this morning were still there in a pile. She filed them away into her “to do later” section of her brain.

  

The left side was the living room and dining room, it was split down the not-quite-middle and on the far wall was the main window. The living room part was a cheap and well-worn L-shaped sofa that ran from the window to the imaginary line Sierra used to divide the space. The left-hand wall had a table mounted into it, held on by a combination of welding and metal brackets. It was accompanied by four chairs although rarely did Sierra wish to spend time with people beyond what she was paid to. The table was solid but cheap-looking, something Sierra had tried to mitigate with a polka-dot tablecloth. Deftly, she carried the mug to the windowsill and sat in her favourite, and only, armchair.

A few final delivery cruisers were primed for Aerinus-Five and Sierra watched as they made their final ascent, silhouetted in the sunset. The sun was beginning to dip below the horizon, illuminating the polluted sky of Aerinus-Four like a searchlight through the sea. Aerunus-Four's atmosphere was heavier than what Core-Three's had been described as so the sunlight didn't pierce as far or as easily. As the last glints of sunlight hopped playfully between the high-rise buildings on the horizon, the dark peace of the night descended over New Hospon. Small ships flew between them, each one trying to reach home before the evening rush hour. Like ants on a skeleton, they buzzed around the capital, individuals unwittingly working together to form a coherent pattern. There was no Aerinus-Four A to light up the skies but she had heard Core-Three A was beautiful and controlled the tides. Terrestrial humans used to call it ‘The Moon’ as if no others existed, Sierra chuckled to herself. It seemed to have many other mystical properties attributed to it.

  

Upturned over the chair’s arm was the book she was reading this morning before her shift. It was "Life Before the Fall", by Charl Faisley, a retelling of what days were like before the war and the Fracture when the Net was still running. It gave her hope that one day humanity would be able to reclimb such technological heights.

  

She was, of course, too young to remember the wars of the 2570s but being born in the late 2590s meant she lived through its repercussions. She grew up seeing the world adjust to being cut off from the others and watched as humanity crawled away from the computers it had relied upon so heavily for so long. She even remembered when the first Delivery came through. When those four massive battlecruisers broke the upper atmosphere, the Ace logos on their hulls glowed the dull silver of hope in the blue light of Aerinus. With them, these cruisers brought Aerinus into the newly interconnected Scion Galaxy. They did this by establishing a postal depot on Aerinus-Five, Sierra’s neighbouring planet. Since the Fall, the quickest way to send interstellar information was through radio waves. Light transmissions were far too faithless to be relied upon, thus leaving communication in the hands of Wireless Fidelity-based connection systems; Wi-Fi as the Digital Mormons called it. She could see the beacon of her planetary depot from her room, it could only send things light-ways to Aerinus-Five but that was enough to stay connected.

  

Sierra looked down and realised she still had her work clothes on. She hated wearing them at home because they reminded her of the early start this coming Monday. Reluctantly, she heaved her aching bones up from the chair. Over at the kitchen counter, she washed her face in the sink, her skin was still grimy from travelling back through the smog and dust that had begun to smother New Hospon but it was refreshing to get it off and forget about the day.  On her way past, she started the heat cycle on whatever food she'd left in the cycler last night.

  

She felt her way through the encroaching darkness and made it to her bedroom, where she flicked on the Glo-Bulb affixed to the wall. The colour was tuned to that reddish tint, just right to not disturb her nightly routine while still being able to see. Tucked into a corner was her washing bag. It was beginning to look full. Curled up on her bed was her pet furcrow, Vincent. He sat like a pom-pom ball of fluff with seemingly no discernable features. Sierra made an educated guess on which part wasn’t his face and gave it a scratch so he knew she was home; it always took him a while to wake up anyway. She shrugged off the straps of her overalls and stepped out of them, flicking them into the washing basket with her foot as she did so. Her jumper was next, pulled over her head and taking with it the elasticated cotton holding her hair back. Both were dumped into the washing for her to consider another day. She peeled off her shirt, neatly folded it and put it back in her wardrobe. Her skin had a slightly bluish tint; her mother had been Lunar or a “member of the H-K5a”, as the corpo-sawbones put it when she was hired. She ran her hands through her hair and gave it a fluff, letting it fall more naturally into a brown fuzzy mass around her shoulders after being tied up the whole day. She tucked it behind her ears and traded her work socks for some fuzzy warm ones that her mother had knitted years ago when she left home.

  

Scooping Vincent up in her arms as she left, Sierra strolled back into the main room and sat back down on the armchair. She whisked her old blanket off of the window sill where it had been warming in the sun all day and wrapped herself up in it before setting Vincent down on her lap and turning on her shortwave communicator. She set it to the receiver setting and tuned it to her and Vincent’s favourite channel. The announcer’s smooth voice shuffled into focus, “Good evening, you’re listening to 103.6, Euphoria FM. Sponsored by Kosmo’s Insta-Bread, never worry about mouldy bread again with Insta-bread, just add water and have a full loaf in minutes!”. He stirred when he heard the music, unfurling himself to look at Sierra. He found that he had been placed on his back and wiggled his little legs to try and right himself. Not willing to let him go that easily, Sierra tickled his tummy and he quickly calmed down. He was shaped somewhat like a salamander; the same-shaped head, the same-shaped tail and the same-shaped feet. Except he had six of them. They were stubby and ended with four tiny little toes, adorned with tiny little pads where his digits touched the ground. He was also entirely coated in thick, red-coloured fur which had black and orange streaks through it. This breed of furcrow is affectionately called a tabby, after the Core-born-felines which exhibited similar striped patterns. Since those times other creatures have been allowed into human households to live with loving families and good food.

  

So they sat, enjoying the company and the music for almost an hour. It was rare that the sunset aligned with the end of her work day but the two of them were grateful for it every time. By this time Sierra’s tea had long since run out, her forgotten food had gone cold and the sun was long gone. Vincent had, predictably, fallen asleep again while she rubbed his back. He let out small, wobbling chirps in his sleep to show he appreciated it. Slowly but surely the headlights in the distance disappeared, leaving only the calm stillness of the night. She reached over and switched off the communicator, leaning back in her chair. This was her favourite part of the day. When the lights were all gone and the planet was quiet. She just sat back and listened to the wind rattling outside, the whooshing of sand and dirt in the currents. She could hear avians in the distance calling to each other quietly as if to say goodnight, and the insects buzzing around the flowers she grew in the window box. She listened to the armchair as it creaked slightly and to Vincent as he mumbled in his sleep, drinking in all of the peace she could while it lasted.

  

When her eyelids began to droop and her arms were feeling heavy enough she scooped Vincent up, placed the blanket back in its place and headed off to bed. She pulled off her socks as she walked into the bedroom and flopped her and Vincent down onto the bed. He was always warm and she was sure the feeling of his fur on her skin gave her good dreams. It also helped that he was always warm, like a bag of Charco-brick embers.

  

Furcrows are famously slow and stupid when left to their own devices in the wild. Their main method of catching their prey, often insectoid creatures or small rodent-like avians, is by spitting at it; their saliva is a natural, if very weak, tranquilliser. It has little to no effect on humans due to their comparative size but Vincent licked Sierra’s hand anyway. He had noticed her struggling to sleep recently and this was the only way he could come up with to help.

  

And with that, the two of them fell fast asleep.

## Chapter 2 - DAY 1

  

Sierra woke up with a start. It had been a few days since that peaceful sunset and things had not become any easier. Pay continued to dwindle and prices continued to rise. Her blinds were broken in the recent sandstorm and she squinted disappointedly into the sunrise peeking through her bedroom door. There was a slam outside; another family was being kicked out or was moving on to greener pastures. She knew it was her opposite neighbour, Eric Forsier, and his family getting kicked out. Eric and his husband moved in about 10 years ago at the same time as she did and so she had become very close friends with them. They were the first people she met after moving out of her home sector on the western side of the city and she was very grateful they were so friendly and welcoming. Their two 7-year-old twins, Francis and Elisa, were absolute joys to be around and Sierra had always promised to herself that she’d watch them grow up. Francis loved dinosaurs; he always had a fact about some obscure marine monster up his sleeve whenever she saw him. Elisa was captivated by Sierra’s rustic style and loved to steal her clothes, not that she ever got very far with them for very long. Elisa and Francis also like to try and steal Vincent and, while he never puts up any serious resistance, once they fall asleep he sneaks out of their grasp and returns to Sierra’s lap, or bed, or wherever she happened to be.

  

A few nights ago, Eric had invited Sierra to join him and Samuel out on the roof for a few drinks once the twins were asleep. They’d discussed the money problems he and Samuel shared, both working at the nearby Galacti-Core palladium refinery. Aerinus had always been a Dragonis system but, with the introduction of the Ace superlim-port on A-5 and the influx in repurposed military surplus subliminal ships, demand for subliminal ships was on a decline. People still wanted personal aero-skimmers and some even personal shuttles, of course, but these days public transport and superliminal jumps were the preferred methods of travel for those caught in corporate traps in this system. Thus the demand for engine parts was declining and the price of refined palladium tanked almost overnight, now the price difference between unrefined and refined palladium was so small that it was difficult for Galactic-Core to justify even being in the palladium business anymore.

All three of them had seen the move coming; Sierra had hung out with the kids last night as a goodbye while Eric made preparations to get his family out and safely ready for the departure on the last day of the coming sector. He would have moved them out earlier but he wanted as much time as possible. They were heading out west to the edge of the continent to meet with some Roamers. It would be a busy but better life for Francis and Elisa, away from the contracts and swindle sheets of this corporate world. It sounded wonderful. But Sierra couldn’t afford to quit. To quit she would need to pay the ‘quitting fee’, an entire year’s salary plus a month for every unfulfilled year on her contract with Kosmo. Her savings were barely half of the former part after ten years of saving let alone taking the remaining hundred or so months that would be added on. Kosmo contracts were notoriously long-lasting but lucrative; they squeezed all the energy out of you but left you reasonably well off to retire early and live a frugal life. Eric and Samuel wouldn’t have to pay this as they were laid off about a week ago and have spent their last credits on safe passage to the dock where the roamers were departing.

  

It was the 8th of the segment today and Sierra had a shift soon. She wished she could have said goodbye to the Forsiers but by the time she got up and put some clothes on, they were gone. They were the last people on this floor other than Sierra and she suddenly realised how alone she was. It was likely all of the apartments below her were empty too and the ones above were so expensive she doubted there had been anyone living there to remove. Somehow she still kept a steady salary just about high enough to pay the rent although she had been forced to remove some Glo-bulbs to save on energy and cut back on Nico-teas at home to save heating the water. She was scraping by and she knew something had to change.

  

When she got to the kitchen to have a morsel of breakfast, she saw that Vincent hadn’t finished the food in his food bowl. She called out to him and he came shuffling in. Upon seeing the bowl being offered to him he shook his head and nudged it towards her. Sierra almost burst into tears right then and there. Vincent had known something was up with her; the lights being off, her seeming exhausted yet unable to sleep, the decline in visitors the past few weeks and especially the slow but obvious decrease in Sierra’s food portions. So he decided he was fine to miss a meal or two if it meant she got to eat, although Sierra had beat him to it and was spending most of her disposable income on his food. She crumpled to her knees and Vincent waddled forward to comfort her. She picked him up and gave him a big hug before catching the clock in the corner of her eye. Comforting him and assuring him that the food was his to eat, she got up, kissed his head, ran into the bedroom and frantically pulled on her overalls. She was almost about to leave when a cold draught from her open window blew down the back of her overalls, the chills suddenly reminding her that she had forgotten both her over-shirt and work socks. She hurried back into the room, found her socks and a somewhat clean shirt, threw them on, shouted goodbye to Vincent and ran out the door.

She turned left out the door and sprinted down the hallway, hopped the railing to the stairs and hit the lower landing running. Before moving to the centre, Sierra lived on her parent’s farm and spent much of her spare time free-running along the building and trees that surrounded her. It was times like these she was thankful for such a skill, careening down the stairs and reaching the ground floor lobby in almost half the time it would have taken the lift to do the same. The clock in the lobby was about 10 minutes slow so she knew she had time to spare before her shuttle left. She sat on the bench just inside the outer door and unhooked her boots from where they were tied on her waist, carefully aligning the pads stitched inside to their most comfortable configurations and slipping them on. She pulled the buckles as tight as she could before doing the laces up, she knew that otherwise, one or both would end up coming undone at work. She stood up and ran into the wind outside.

  

It took her about five minutes to fight through the morning dust devil to get to the shuttle station and she was even early enough to catch the one before. Few people in this galaxy wanted to be any earlier to work than they had to, so the earlier shuttles were almost empty. Sierra paid her dues and slumped into an empty row. She leaned on her elbow and looked out of the window as the shuttle pulled away. The craft shuddered as the engines grumbled to life. Sandy winds whipped at its winds and viewports but, as the shuttle rose above the streets of New Hospon, gritty currents gave way to the skyline glistening in the mid-morning sun. The atmosphere was thick and heavy in its highest layers; between the sandstorms on the surface and the dark clouds above, a clear slice of sky let the sunlight shine onto the skyscrapers of the city centre as they combed the clouds. It is ironic that such beautiful views could be found on a planet so bereft of any other value. If the wildlife were more plentiful, it could have been an interest for xenobiologists. If the land had been preserved, then it could have been a tourist hotspot in this sector. What Aerinus-Four did have was empty land, and a lot of it, which was perfect for geno-farming. Various ranches could be found on the plant's opposite side, some home to millions of livestock. Unfortunately, it was in Kosmo’s tainted grasp and they intended to strip it of its value from the last people here to whom it still held any. Even less fortunate, Kosmo was the most reliable employer in this sector and was the only reasonable option left when Sierra’s application for off-world employment was rejected.

  

Aerinus-Four was not a cold planet, during the day, but the drastic temperature difference between the day and night caused it to have very high wind speeds. At midday, one could find themselves directly under the sun, the eye of the storm, and the wind would eerily die down to be still for an hour or so. Without the wind, Aerinus-Four was hideously dry and dusty. After the hour had passed, often residents would be thankful for the wind returning. At night the winds on the surface died down and the dust was allowed to settle. At the same time, the winds of the upper strata of the atmosphere were deathly quick, tearing the clouds to shreds and leaving an almost perfect view of the stars. Local rotations of Aerinus-Four lasted about twenty hours, two-thirds of the Galactic Standard Day, so often the day and night cycle was about one segment out from one day to the next.

  

Even this early in the morning, shuttles were back to buzzing around the spires in the distance and Sierra wondered where they could all be going; insects unwittingly following the swarm from meeting to meeting and place to place. If she continued down this path she knew she’d end up in one of those air-busses: just another burnt-out chemist moving from office to office, talking about stuff she didn’t care about to corpos who didn’t know any better. Young adults like her don’t often get to stay in one place, corporations tend to use them up and send them further down the inescapable pipeline of bureaucracy when they’re wrung dry. Maybe the things she’d seen as bad omens were just signs of change. What if … No, this was a foolish thought but she finished it anyway. What if she could escape? Maybe follow the Forsiers and join up with roamers out west. Or spend her last credits on an aero-skimmer and 5 days of rations to try and make it to the shipyard at the pole, join a mercenary crew and live a life of adventure! These ideas were, of course, ludicrous and inconceivably unlikely to succeed. Still, it was nice to imagine she had a glimmer of hope, a peak every so often through the cracks of the corporate facade at what lay in the open plains beyond the wall. But … A life on the road with Vincent didn’t sound so bad, actually. She was confident she could catch something to eat frequently enough to keep the both of them going. She was fairly sure she could get work mending ships for passing travellers and be able to barter for enough fuel to keep the skimmer running. It was almost beginning to sound plausible; if she didn’t have to worry about that Quitting Fee. The Fee was always the roadblock at the end of a dream and this time, just like every other, there seemed to be no way around.

  

The shuttle had a few more stops before hitting the Kosmo headquarters to the south of the city. This encampment was the third largest in the sector, taking up almost five thousand square kilometres, plus at least double in farming areas that snaked out from it in all directions. Sierra worked in the northern complex, closest to the city, so she didn’t have to wait another hour on the shuttle. It touched down in the middle of landing pad eight and she hopped off, shielding her face from the biting wind. She stomped across the dusty ground and into the lobby. “Good morning [STARLING, SIERRA], have a productive day!”, said the hollow, empty voice of the announcer as they had to every morning. Artificial intelligence had been banned for decades by now; behind that voice was a person just doing what they were programmed to. Specifically, that person was Harri the AURA. AURAs are technically robots, just like Sierra is a variant, but most regarded them both equally as people nonetheless. Sierra had been impressed with its heuristic nature of replying until she realised it was selecting randomly from a preset list of responses. She’s heard each of them so many times she could hear them in her sleep. Once she’d crossed the lobby she stepped into the reception office. “Hey Harri, how are the fields looking today?” She gave the usual greeting. They weren’t allowed to ‘chat on the job’ according to the Kosmo officers in charge so the two of them had created a code that sounded like farming jargon. Of course, the officers had no clue what really went down on the fields or in the labs so they would be none the wiser – if they even cared enough to listen.

  

Behind the desk sat a beautiful mechanoid, specifically an AURA model, standing for Artificial Unit of something or other - Sierra had never found it pertinent to ask. It was very strange to find one in a managerial position; AURAs were some of the hardiest workers available and Harri is immune to the pesticide- and chemical-based hazard Sierra was used to as a chemist. Rumour had it that some officer just wanted something nice to look at and, while it could be viewed as a waste of good resources, she empathised with Harri wanting to take a step back from manual labour without causing much fuss. She’d always liked the slender and curved design of the AURA; it was based on some perfect woman, long prophesied and with mathematically ideal proportions. Harri had painted themself pastel red with soft orange accents to bring out their best features, it looked like a professional job. Harri was also, unusually for an AURA, wearing some clothes; Sierra had bought them a nice jacket for their yearly software update last year and they hadn’t taken it off since. With a tuft of dark red hair swept over the top of it, their face was slender with sharp features and yet soft enough to be perpetually approachable. Harri’s faces positively lit up when they smiled, if it was genuine at least. Currently, this one was twisted into an obviously fake smile but it relaxed into a genuine one when they realised that it was just Sierra, Harri replied “The sands were rough last night and grain is running low but the avians left the new buds alone.” Harri’s night had been fairly middling: their neighbours were noisy and money was short but at least the debt collectors gave them a break this time. “Perhaps we should meet and compare notes? I’ve been having some ideas about taking some theories outside into the fields and I am sure the animals would like to see you again.” Harri’s mechanical expression noticeably raised at the suggestion of an escape and raised even higher at the suggestion of Vincent, “How about I leave the equipment by the shuttle port at sundown?”, they asked. “I would like that very much”, Sierra smiled before turning and walking into the main lab to start her shift. She heard an almost imperceptible, abstruse giggle of excitement when she was around the corner and smiled to herself.

  

Entering the lab was a faff at the best of times but, after years of sand and dust ingress, the security system was getting sloppy. Sierra pulled out her employee punch card and slid it into the slot by the door. The CRT display above her flickered to life and showed an animated letter ’K’ scrutinising a cartoon identification card. It ate up her card and rather noisily processed for what seemed like an eternity until it was satisfied and spat it back out. DENIED read the message on the screen. “Oh for fu-”, Sierra blew on the card, whapped it back and forth on her leg to hopefully get any dust out, and fed it back to the machine again. This time it was marginally quicker yet somehow even louder. The whirring and clicking paused every so often for the animatic to restart but eventually, it was finished. DENIED read the screen again. Sierra knew it was fruitless to try again, so instead she just stepped forward and hammered on the door, “Hello? The scanner’s on the fritz again, can you let me in?” A shuffling could be heard on the other side of the door. It slid upwards to reveal a small and stout old man peering up at her. “I’m gonna have to scan it from here before I can let you in, Sierra.” His accent was distinctly rhotic and nasal but friendly nonetheless. Sierra sighed, “Fine, Thoren, take it; I’m not exactly itching to start. Why are you here so early?” She asked, handing him the card. “As on every day, that is none of your business young lady.” He replied with a smug smile. They both knew Sierra’s card would scan perfectly fine but the officers demanded they all stick to protocol.

  

Once she was in the lab she got down to work. What exactly she was trying to achieve was beyond her but she followed the instructions on the monitor until her break timer went off. They never changed and she didn’t need them anymore; mix this with that, wait for that to crystalize, distil that and add this to it, etc. Eventually, the chemical was concocted and she dragged the barrel into the greenhouse to distribute. She started work at around 10:00, and had her first break at around 17:00 or 18:00, depending on how quickly she could accomplish her task. At 17:30 the overseeing officer was rather pleased with their progress and sounded the timer for the lab workers to go on break for half an hour, after which they all would have another 7 hours of work before they were sent home. At the timer, Sierra carefully set down the barrel she was pouring and made her way to the break corner. Kosmo had elected not to make it a break room, to discourage the employees from doing unscrupulous things outside of the direct eye-line of their superiors, so a break corner was all they got. It was pretty barren even for a corporate break area; a single table with chairs scattered around it and an ‘optional minifridge’ which was just a refrigerated vending machine they had to stock themselves. In a lab full of scientists and hazardous chemicals, it was not long after its installation that someone ‘accidentally’ spilt something on the device that made the credit reader stop working and allowed the workers to use it just as anyone would a regular fridge. The officers either hadn't noticed or didn't care enough to get it fixed, presumably because they knew it would just ‘malfunction’ again within a few days. 

  

Thoren was already sitting at the table with Farrace, Yaro, Gus and Harri. He’d fetched an Alco-pop from the fridge for each of them and he handed Sierra hers when she arrived. The rest of the chemists soon joined them, although there were not enough seats at the table to accommodate everyone even though this was the least populated area in the compound. Sierra couldn’t imagine how cramped the other workers must be, desks packed together like vac-packed pteropods. She sat and relaxed with her beer and looked around at her coworkers. Harri had also been given a beer although they couldn’t, or wouldn't, drink it; perhaps just waiting to give it away to whoever looked most like they needed a second on to get through the shift today. Sierra was the beneficiary this time, probably because she had invited them over to hang out after work. 

  

Such offers from organics are rare; shifts are so long people tend to go home, eat and fall asleep immediately. Sierra was seemingly more than half Lunar because, on top of slightly blue skin, inconvenient hair problems and marginally heightened physical abilities, something she also inherited from her mother was not needing as much sleep as a human. The rest of the team were ostensibly human, excluding Harri of course, except Yaro. Yaro was an Aqua - an unusual sight in such a light and dry climate as the one New Hospon resided in, he would be much better suited to another continent, or even another planet; Aerinus-Eight or -Nine which have much denser fluids covering their surfaces. He had webbed fingers, requiring Kosmo to reluctantly custom manufacture gloves for him, and a hunchback where his spine pushed against his skin. In the daytime shifts, he also wore specific goggles he brought with him from his homeworld. Sierra once asked him what they are for and he replied that they help him ‘see past the glare of the sun’. She had a theory that he used them to cover his eyes so he could nap secretly while he was waiting for the distiller.

  

With the Alco-pops drank and a few ritual stretches done, Sierra walked back outside to her barrel and picked it up again. The alcohol was clearly working and it definitely felt lighter than when she set it down earlier. She hoisted it onto her shoulder and began to distribute its gloopy green contents across her plot. It was another batch of fertiliser for the Parsnaps she was assigned to and she could see their leaves growing nicely above their sand-soil warrens. Parsnaps were feisty and familiar creatures. They liked crunchy sand-soil because combing for nutrients kept their spines short; they were liable to grow long enough to be a hazard if left untouched and pruning them manually just made the parsnaps stressed, producing a small and bitter yield. Sierra loved her gang of parsnaps. Contrary to the recommended operating procedures, the first few sectors of each harvest rotation were spent just getting to know them and letting them get comfortable with her.

  

By the time she'd emptied the barrel, the fertiliser had started seeping into the soil and they were waking up, stretching slightly in the false sunlight of the Glo-bulbs. They emerged slowly from their warrens, their nightly layer of protective bark cracking and splintering as they moved. They were asymmetric pentapeds, with three legs on one side and two on the other or vice versa in some cases. On the side where they had two legs, they grew spines which they used to extract moisture and nutrients from the soil during their sleep. Disfigured, circular heads sat on top of their oblong bodies which had ocular sensory organs dotted irregularly on their entire surface area. Each one was unique and different and the moss-like fur they were covered in came in millions of different patterns, textures and colours. Often families shared similar patterns and species shared similar colours so it was relatively simple to categorise them. Parsnaps were often known to mix colours and patterns anyway, seemingly what was used to attract a mate was unique to an individual rather than the species as a whole. Some didn't find mates, some found them just in their proximity and some found what they were looking for in their batch by coincidence. It was often therapeutic for Sierra to just sit and watch them play in their troughs, dancing around and following each other across the mud. Her particular batch were Aerinian Savanna Parsnaps, native to this system, and came in red and brown colours, to blend in with the other flora found on the subcontinent. She had two families in her pen right now, one tended to be mostly dark brown with dark red stripes and the other mostly red with a light brown gradient towards their feet. 

  

One of the parsnaps slowly ambled towards her. His name was Terrence and he was secretly her favourite of this batch. He didn't have any particularly extreme qualities about him: he wasn't the largest or smallest parsnap, he had within one standard deviation of the quantity and length of his leaves, and his eyes were not particularly even or particularly irregular. However, he was the most recognisable. Once he reached where Sierra was kneeling he climbed onto her lap, making sure not to poke her with his spines, and just stood. Parsnaps, being vegetables, don't have a wide range of movement so cannot ‘sit’ as one would expect. So they simply just stay still. It is a sign of great trust and comfort if a parsnap does not mind being watched by you or decides to stay by your side when still.

  

Terrence remained there for quite a while until Sierra was certain her supervisors were watching her and she got up to continue tending the flock as they grazed on the fertiliser, making sure none of them fell over or started fighting each other. Parsnaps are slow and peaceful organisms so this was generally the best part of any given work sprint. They were nearing the end of the season, with only a few days left before the culling was due at the end of this sector and the new seeds would be sown. Sierra hated that part but she was used to it. Parsnaps were vegetables at the end of the day and, while sentient, were to be treated as such without exception. They tended to only live a year in the wild anyway so any given individual would be dead within the next five galactic sectors. Sierra liked to save them but she could only really get away with one ending up ‘not fit for consumption’ per batch so they were all unwittingly in a competition to see who would be saved. This year Terrence was in the lead by a landslide and Sierra also thought he would get along well with Vincent. 

  

The remainder of the shift was spent watching the horde while distilling more fertiliser. If she made a surplus today, she wouldn’t have to work as hard tomorrow, if she disguised it correctly. Sierra toiled away at her station until the glo-bulbs dimmed, always keeping her pen in her peripheral vision in case a fight broke out. The shifts she was constrained to were also the waking hours of the livestock; they rise when the employees arrive and their ‘sun’ starts to set towards the end of the shift. This meant leaving at odd exterior light levels every day was disarming when the interior brightness had such a regular schedule.

  

By the time the lights were dimming, the herds were safely back in their warrens and given enough nutrients to tide them over until tomorrow and employees were back at their stations tidying up before they went home. Sierra was almost the last to leave; she picked up Harri on the way through and they headed off to the shuttle bay to catch the last shuttle back to Sierra’s district. The departure was much more pleasant than the arrival just by the addition of someone to talk to. Sierra and Harri exchanged idle small talk for all of the journey, gossiping about the news and trying to predict the state of the city in the next few days.

# Notes

  
  

Unruly workers -> ace sends in the big guns

  

4 days until nomads depart -> curfew/blockade instated on citizens?

  

Sierra has to race to the departure point before they leave and she is stuck in the city

  

She has to navigate the chaos of economic collapse and a military occupation to reach safety 

  

Sierra joins Charon at the end? Given a key card and told a client has made contact. The key card has the name Meridian on it -> cliffhanger into muvva chapter 3!!! :)

Or she dies
